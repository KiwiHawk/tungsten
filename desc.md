Fair warning, this is currently an "alpha" release, there may be bugs.

Adds wolframite (mineable tungsten ore), tungsten plates, tungsten carbide, and rocket engine nozzles to factorio.
Modifies several recipes to use new resources and intermediates. 

If you enjoy vanilla Factorio, Krastorio 2, or Space Exploration, and would like to add a new resource, this mod might be what you're looking for. 
Tungsten is slightly more complex than [Titanium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium) or [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead), and the ore is usable at green science, a stage right between those two mods. 
It will broaden your factory close to the same time that [Silica & Silicon](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzsilicon) is kicking into gear, as well.

Wolframite is mineable with water, or if Krastorio 2 is enabled, with Mineral Water.
Tungsten carbide can only be made in stone or steel furnaces or, if Krastorio 2 is enabled, with coke in any furnace.


Supported compatible mods:
- Space Exploration & AAI
- Krastorio 2 & Rich Rocks Requiem
- Other mods like Omnimatter, 
- Several smaller mods like Deadlock Stacking, Deadlock Crating, Jetpack, Aircraft, Simple Compress,  The Big Furnace, etc.

Many other mods are compatible, but not yet fully supported. Compatibility suggestions always appreciated.
